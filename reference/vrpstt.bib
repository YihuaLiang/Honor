	In the stochastic variant of the vehicle routing problem with time
	windows, known as the SVRPTW, travel times are assumed to be stochastic.
	In our chance-constrained approach to the problem, restrictions are
	placed on the probability that individual time window constraints
	are violated, while the objective remains based on traditional routing
	costs. In this paper, we propose a way to offer this probability,
	or service level, for all customers. Our approach carefully considers
	how to compute the start-service time and arrival time distributions
	for each customer. These distributions are used to create a feasibility
	check that can be â€œpluggedâ€� into any algorithm for the VRPTW
	and thus be used to solve large problems fairly quickly. Our computational
	experiments show how the solutions change for some well-known data
	sets across different levels of customer service, two travel time
	distributions, and several parameter settings.},

  abstract  = {This study considers a multi-trip split-delivery vehicle routing problem with soft time windows for daily inventory replenishment under stochastic travel times. Considering uncertainty in travel times for vehicle routing problems is beneficial because more robust schedules can be generated and unanticipated consequences can be reduced when schedules are implemented in reality. However, uncertainties in model parameters have rarely been addressed for the problems in this category mainly due to the high problem complexity. In this study, an innovative and practical approach is proposed to consider stochastic travel times in the planning process. In the planning model, the possible outcomes of vehicle arrivals and product delivery at retailers are systematically categorized and their associated penalty and reward are estimated. Thus, unanticipated costs for every scheduling decision can be incorporated into the planning model to generate vehicle routing schedules that are more robust facing uncertain traffic conditions. To solve the model that is characterized as an NP-hard problem in a reasonable amount of time, a two-stage heuristic solution algorithm is proposed. Finally, the stochastic model is compared with the deterministic model in both planning and simulated operation stages using the data of a supply chain in Taiwan. The result confirms that the schedule generated by the stochastic model is more robust than the one created with the deterministic model because undesired outcomes such as unfulfilled demands are greatly reduced.},

	Abstract The vehicle routing problem with hard time windows and stochastic

	form of a chance-constrained model mainly differs from other vehicle
	routing problems with stochastic service or travel times considered
	in the literature by the presence of hard time windows. This makes
	the problem extremely challenging. In this paper, we model the VRPTW-ST
	as a two-stage stochastic program and define two recourse policies
	to recover operations feasibility when the first stage plan turns
	out to be infeasible. We formulate the VRPTW-ST as a set partitioning
	problem and solve it by exact branch-cut-and-price algorithms. Specifically,
	we developed efficient labeling algorithms by suitably choosing label
	components, determining extension functions, and developing lower
	and upper bounds on partial route reduced cost to be used in the
	column generation step. Results on benchmark data show that our methods
	are able to solve instances with up to 50 customers for both recourse
	policies.},

Abstract
Vehicle scheduling plays a profound role in public transit planning. Traditional approaches for the Vehicle Scheduling Problem (VSP) are based on a set of predetermined trips in a given timetable. Each trip contains a departure point/time and an arrival point/time whilst the trip time (i.e. the time duration of a trip) is fixed. Based on fixed durations, the resulting schedule is hard to comply with in practice due to the variability of traffic and driving conditions. To enhance the robustness of the schedule to be compiled, the VSP based on stochastic trip times instead of fixed ones is studied. The trip times follow the probability distributions obtained from the data captured by Automatic Vehicle Locating (AVL) systems. A network flow model featuring the stochastic trips is devised to better represent this problem, meanwhile the compatibility of any pair of trips is redefined based on trip time distributions instead of fixed values as traditionally done. A novel probabilistic model of the VSP is proposed with the objectives of minimizing the total cost and maximizing the on-time performance. Experiments show that the probabilistic model may lead to more robust schedules without increasing fleet size.},

	The Stochastic Vehicle Routing Problem (SVRP) results when one or

	the VRP with stochastic demands (VRPSD). The framework can be adapted
	easily for routing problems with randomness in other problem elements,
	such as random customers and random travel times. We formulate the
	VRPSD as a two-stage stochastic program and introduce an extended
	recourse strategy in which vehicles are allowed to serve additional
	customers from failed routes prior to returning to the depot or to
	serve customers from failed routes on a new route after returning
	to the depot. Computational experiments show that route plans generated
	using the new recourse function perform quite well, especially for
	problems with few customers per route, where cost savings of roughly
	5\% are possible.},
